The blood bank system is considered one of the most important systems in the
health field as it is a well-established standard method for treating patients who
suffer from a deficiency in one or more of the blood components, and therefore it
is an essential part of health care.
The organization of blood transfusion services should receive the most attention
and care for the smooth functioning of obtaining different blood groups and saving
patients, the goal of the transfusion service is to provide blood and active blood
components that are as safe as possible and sufficient to meet the needs of the
patient.
-This system contains a page to login, and then the user chooses if he is a patient
looking for a specific blood type -or if he is a donor who wants to donate.
Then the system contains a page for available and missing blood groups
If it is available, the patient is asked to reserve his blood type, and if it is not
available, a message will be shown to him that this type is not available
If the user is a blood donor, if the blood types are available, the donation process is
not carried out, and if it is incomplete, he will fill in the data and the donation process will take place
